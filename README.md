# Lord of the Objects Project:

Homework 2

Skill Distillery class SD-22

# Overview:

The Mission, should you accept it... is to get deeper in Classes and Objects to create a terminal based 
game.  In this game; enemies will be created, treasures will need to be acquired, the risk
of loosing will be real, and randomness will be used to decide outcome.

This is a Team Project that adds the potential for conflict amongst programmers and the
rewards of collaboration.

# Technologies Used:

- Java
- Eclipse
- GitHub
- Atom
- UML
- Flow Diagram

# Synopsis:

This two person team chose a rated G theme based on the old Looney Tunes cartoons.
The player interacts with them as some are friends who can help and others are enemies to defeat.
The location is based on real life areas of the Four Corners States.  It starts in
Hatch, New Mexico and ends in Mesa Verde, Colorado.  We also brought in some extra bad guys;
 namely some Roswell Aliens to help Marvin the Martian who is the villain in this
 story.

 # Lessons Learned:

 Collaboration on larger projects can be difficult and beneficial.

 My partner had never played a RPG or text based game before in his life, so the concept
 was totally new to him. I had to explain what I thought were obvious
 concepts to him, like how text based games flow and what happens in them.

 We incorporated many concepts from the past two weeks. The biggest challenge was including user input for choices in a 
 variety of scenes. It seemed to overload the scanner. 

 Creating classes and objects and using them in the proper way while following UML guidelines
 was a keylesson.
